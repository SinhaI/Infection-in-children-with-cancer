In this repository we have added the code used to generate the circos plot for this article. In this plot we wanted to show the gene expression profile detected throuth RNA sequencing. The Circos plot depicting up- and down-regulated genes for the three comparisons (virus vs. control = inner violet circle; co-infection vs control = middle green circle and unknown vs control = outer yellow circle).
